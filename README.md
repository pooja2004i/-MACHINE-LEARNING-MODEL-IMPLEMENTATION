Task 4: Machine Learning Model Implementation
The final task required building a predictive model using Scikit-learn. I chose a spam detection model where the dataset was trained using the Naive Bayes algorithm.
Machine Learning (ML) model implementation involves building a predictive or classification model using data and algorithms that learn patterns automatically. This task is essential for applications such as spam detection, sentiment analysis, image recognition, and more. It gives learners a foundational understanding of how data can be used to train machines to make intelligent decisions.
Objective:
The main goal of this task is to build a machine learning model using Python and the scikit-learn library. The model should be able to analyze input data, learn from it, and make predictions or classifications based on new, unseen data. The task involves the complete pipeline: from loading and preprocessing the data to training, testing, and evaluating a machine learning model.

Tools and Libraries Used:
Programming Language: Python
Overall, the internship was a valuable learning experience that enhanced my technical and problem-solving skills across different domains in Python.
